# Connect-Four

I created the classic game Connect Four utilizing Python and Python's Turtle module. 

This interactive game is built to be played by two players. The goal of the game is to drop the colored discs (red or yellow) into the grid and to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four from one's own discs. Each player can drop a disc into the grid by clicking the arrow above the column they wish to drop the disc, within the GUI. When the arrow is clicked, the disc will drop to the lowest available space in the respective column.

There are two files representing the two classes, used in the project, in addition to the main driver, connect4_driver.py. One class named Board, built within connect4_board.py and one class named Game, built in connect4_game.py. Run the driver to play the game.

If running the driver file in a Python-compatible IDE does not work, run the driver in IDLE, Python's default IDE, to play the game.
