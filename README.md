# Connect-Four

This is a Connect Four game created, as a school project, utilizing Python and Python's Turtle module. If running the driver file in a Python-compatible IDE does not work, run the driver in IDLE, Python's default IDE, to play the game.

There are two files representing the two classes, used in the project, in addition to the main driver, connect4_driver.py. One class named Board, built within connect4_board.py and one class named Game, built in connect4_game.py.
